A prototype implementation of a debit machine whose code was written in C using Stm32Cube development toolchain. The functionality was built around a state machine design where each stage represented an action being performed by the user(Eg: Enter Pin) in response to which the system transitioned from one state to other(Eg: Move to state Transaction successful or Transaction declined)
